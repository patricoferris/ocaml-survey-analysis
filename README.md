OCaml User Survey 2020
----------------------

A small amount of analysis for the OCaml User Survey 2020 primarily to look into how choices differ between more or less proficient users of OCaml and how long they've been using the language. 

If you want to reuse this, try downloading [the survey results](http://cambium.inria.fr/~xleroy/tmp/OCaml-user-survey.csv.zip) to a `ocs.csv` file next to the notebook.
